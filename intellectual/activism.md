Some presumptuous tips on making a difference and trying to fix the world.

Many of us have an innate desire to fix the things we *see wrong* in the universe, but it’s worth taking a moment to consider some obvious truths about this feeling.

1. **Pick your fights.** You cannot fix *everything*. Accept it.  
2. **Match effort to influence.** Your level of effort on *Issue X* should roughly correspond to how much __control__ and *influence* you actually have over it. Taking too big a bite can choke you.  
3. **Most issues are outside your control.** So *Hey Jude, refrain — don’t carry the world upon your shoulders.*  
4. **Control exists on a spectrum.** It ranges from low to high, or high to low — whatever framework works for you.  
5. **High-control issues demand action.**  
    - If you can truly influence something, there are *no excuses* for not trying to fix it.  
    - Feel some **shame** if you don’t.  
    - Study the issue in-depth.  
    - Have a clear stance.  
    - Consider practical solutions and possible fixes.  
6. **Low-control issues allow restraint.**  
    - For most of these, just **let them go**.  
    - Still, try a bit to **understand** them, proportional to your sphere of influence.  
    - Stay somewhat **informed**.  
    - Have at least a **stance**, even if minimal.  
7. **Not everything “wrong” is truly wrong.** Double- and triple-check whether *Issue X* is actually worth solving.

**Cautious reminder:** Often, it’s far more productive to focus on working with influential or motivated individuals to change institutions, and let the average person be.
