## Computation
[Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram), amongst others, mentions that we used to compartamentalized computational problems. For instance, we used to think that sorting a list of words, or computing square roots, or determining if a particular phrase is palindromic were three different things. However, since [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) and [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) we now know that they are computationally the same problems, universal computation.

One interesting implication from this revelation is that technically we can compute _anything_, once we have the newest and greatest models and the most powerlful enough machinery. Wolfram uses the term _computational irreducibility_ to say this is perhaps mistaken. Maybe there is no easy theory for any behavior that seems complex. You cannot __predict__ the outcome beforehand, and the program must still be **run**, for us to get an answer. However, isn't all this a predicate of complexity theory, and also related implications of [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems), especially regarding [the halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), ideas which are almost 100 years old?

By the way, caring about computation is essential because it leads us to paradigm shifts. One of the most famous example was [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus)'s notion that we're not at the center of the universe. Before and after Copernicus, computing planetary positions with [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy)'s epicycles was and is adequate for most situations, albeit not as accurate. So, we care about paradigm shifts because they usually bring forth more accuracy to our understanding.
