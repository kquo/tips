# Discourse
Tips for improving discussions and making them more fruitful and enjoyable.

Based on the ideas of experts like [Carl Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers), [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper), [Anatol Rapoport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatol_Rapoport), [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett), and others in this field, we can say that people have mostly figured out __how to argue properly__ with other **_reasonable_** people.

When talking with most people, it's important to keep in mind that not everyone is **_reasonable_**. Some people, for various reasons, such as believing in [pseudoscience](pseudoscience), may not be open to discussion. In situations like these, it's best to avoid trying to have *rational* conversations altogether. As an alternative, consider the **Having Impossible Conversations** section below.

## Discourse Protocol
For productive and enjoyable discussions try following the Discourse Protocol (DP):

1. *Do not* proceed until all sides agree on below simple list:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>An appropriate time and place for the exchange</li>
    <li>Be ready to tolerate criticism</li>
    <li>Choose to <b>pause</b> or even <b>end</b> the debate at any time</li>
    </ol>
2. Follow below simple guidelines:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>Listen attentively and make the other side feel understood</li>
    <li>As Dennet points out, when you try to explain what the other side thinks, make it so clear that they might say, "Thanks, I wish I had said it like that!"</li>
    <li>Be humble and ask honest questions to seek understanding</li>
    <li>Talk things over rationally, preferably using <a href="https://que.one/science/">science</a></li>
    <li>Really think about the idea that you could be wrong and the other side could be right</li>
    <li>Remember that agreement is comparatively unimportant, as both side could easily be mistaken (<a href="popper.md">Karl Popper</a>)</li>
    </ol>
3. Repeat items #1 and #2 until any party enacts Item #1c

## Having Impossible Conversations
[Peter_Boghossian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Boghossian) and [James A. Lindsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Lindsay) wrote a great book in 2019 entitled [How to Have Impossible Conversations: A Very Practical Guide](https://a.co/d/3xpHH8x), which is a valuable source of information regarding this topic. This is a very brief, still incomplete, and probably a bit unfair take on their message, but maybe a good mnemonic for some:

- Modeling
  - Be/do what you want them to do
  - Admit ignorance
- Words
  - Be careful
  - Understand their definitions
- Ask questions
  - How/What calibrated open-ended questions, that don't lead to simple Yes/No
- Acknowledge extremists
  - Create a basis, a bridge
  - Acknowledge extremists on **your side**, to help bridge the moral divide for your oponent
    - "Antifa are a bunch of fanatics/zealots/radicals and should be arrested"
    - "Looters are destructive whackos and need to be stopped"
  - Don't expect reciprocation - just build trust
  - Treat their side charitably
- Don't blame, focus on contribution
- Focus on epistemology
  - How do they know what they claim to know
- Learn what makes someone closed-minded
