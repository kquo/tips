# Reflexivity Curriculum
This document presents a minimalist reflexivity curriculum and is intentionally provisional, meant to evolve through application, failure, and revision. To be clear, **reflexivity** is the name I give to a set of overlapping ideas discussed by different thinkers — often using different terms — outlined in the [Foundation](#foundation) section. I am not a scholar, and this is not a formal theory; it is a practical synthesis based on reading the literature and on lived experience with communities and institutions that routinely resist examining their own assumptions.

**Purpose:** Reduce collective error by embedding reflexivity into norms, structures, and practices  
**Unit of change:** Groups (while remaining usable by motivated individuals) 
**Duration:** Ongoing (embedded, not workshop-based)  
**Prerequisite:** None  
**Core principle:** People become reflective when unreflective behavior has costs.


## Foundation
This curriculum is grounded in a shared conclusion drawn from multiple traditions in philosophy, education, psychology, and organizational theory:

Reflexivity is **not** a natural individual capacity, **not** reliably self-discovered, and **not** sustained without social and institutional support.

- **[Julia Galef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Galef)** shows that exhortations to “be rational” fail unless people confront fear, ego defense, and identity attachment; reflexivity requires emotional as well as cognitive work.
- **[John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey)** argues that reflective thinking is a learned social habit, cultivated through norms and institutions rather than spontaneous insight, and that communities must actively reward it.
- **[Paulo Freire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire)** demonstrates that critical consciousness emerges through collective dialogue and praxis; people cannot recognize their own cognitive captivity in isolation.
- **[Pierre Bourdieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu)** is explicit that most individuals do not achieve reflexivity without external pressure, and that even reflexive systems must examine their own blind spots.
- **[Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas)** reframes the problem away from self-awareness and toward designing discourse conditions that systematically expose poor reasoning.
- **[Jonathan Haidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt)** provides the evolutionary constraint: human reasoning evolved to justify intuition, not to seek truth.
- **[Chris Argyris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Argyris)** shows that organizations routinely punish reflexivity unless norms and incentives are deliberately redesigned.

**Known limitation:**  
These approaches all acknowledge — implicitly or explicitly — that reflexivity is difficult, unevenly distributed, and politically vulnerable. This curriculum does not claim to solve that problem; it assumes it, and is designed to operate despite it.


## I. Foundational Norms (Discourse Layer)
These norms govern all serious discussion. They are mandatory and non-negotiable.

### Norm 1: Claims Require Stakes
Every non-trivial claim must include:
- A confidence level (numeric or ordinal)
- A condition under which the speaker would revise or abandon the claim

**Enforcement prompt:**  
> “What evidence would make this false for you?”

**Function:** Forces implicit beliefs into explicit, testable form.

### Norm 2: Mandatory Steelmanning
Before criticizing a position, participants must:
- Articulate the strongest version of the opposing view
- Receive confirmation from an advocate of that view

**Function:** Prevents caricature and reflexive dismissal without requiring empathy.

### Norm 3: Disagreement Is Logged, Not Resolved
Substantive disagreements are recorded with:
- Competing claims
- Expected consequences or predictions
- A scheduled review date

**Function:** Shifts discourse from persuasion to accountability.


## II. Practice Modules (Community Layer)
These are repeatable group exercises that cultivate reflexivity indirectly.

### Module 1: Prediction Tracking
Participants make short- or medium-term predictions about:
- Policy outcomes
- Organizational decisions
- Social or institutional changes

Predictions are:
- Publicly logged
- Periodically reviewed

**Key rule:** Accuracy is rewarded more than confidence.

**Rationale:** Public divergence between confidence and outcomes produces reflexivity without introspection.

### Module 2: Belief Autopsies
When a shared belief or decision fails, the group conducts a structured review:
1. What assumptions were made?
2. Why did they seem reasonable at the time?
3. What incentives or norms reinforced them?

**Rules:**
- No blame
- No “unforeseeable circumstances”
- No retrospective justification

**Function:** Normalizes error analysis without moralizing failure.

### Module 3: Rotating Devil’s Advocate
A formal role assigned on a rotating basis:
- Not voluntary
- Protected from social penalties
- Evaluated on quality of critique, not agreement

**Function:** Externalizes doubt so individuals do not bear personal or reputational costs.


## III. Structural Safeguards (Institution Layer)
These mechanisms make reflexivity unavoidable rather than aspirational.

### Safeguard 1: Decision–Evaluation Separation
Those who:
- Propose or advocate a plan  
cannot
- Evaluate its success

**Function:** Breaks self-justification and sunk-cost loops.

### Safeguard 2: Reflexivity Audits
Periodic reviews assess:
- Which beliefs changed
- Which beliefs never changed
- Which beliefs were never examined

**Rule:**  
If no beliefs change over time, the process is considered defective.

### Safeguard 3: Incentive Alignment
Rewards are tied to:
- Calibration (confidence vs accuracy)
- Willingness to revise positions
- Quality of uncertainty articulation

Sanctions apply to:
- Unfalsifiable claims
- Retrospective rationalization
- Identity-based reasoning that resists evidence


## IV. Meta-Reflexivity
This layer addresses reflexivity failure itself.

### Rule: Reflexivity Is Not a Virtue
No credit is given for:
- Declared open-mindedness
- Self-ascribed rationality

Only observable behaviors count.

**Required evidence includes:**
- Documented belief revision
- Clear disconfirming trigger


### Anti-Capture Mechanism
At regular intervals, the group must ask:
> “What beliefs does this system make harder to question?”

This includes scrutiny of:
- The curriculum itself
- Moderators or facilitators
- Embedded values and assumptions


## V. Failure Modes (Explicitly Acknowledged)
This curriculum assumes:
- Some participants will never internalize reflexivity
- Some will game norms strategically
- Some beliefs are identity-locked and resistant to revision

**Goal:** Error reduction at the group level, not universal enlightenment.


## VI. Why This Works When Books Don’t
This system does not rely on:
- Insight
- Humility
- Good faith

It relies on:
- Repetition
- Public record
- Incentives
- Constraint

**Reflexivity is treated as hygiene, not wisdom.**
