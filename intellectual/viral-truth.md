# Making Truth Go Viral: Competing With Lies in the Attention Economy
Truth does not spread by default; lies do. Lies are simpler, more emotional, and faster to produce. If truth is to compete, it must be engineered to win on the same terrain where lies thrive.

## 1. Speed Is Non‑Negotiable
Truth that arrives late loses.
- Pre‑bunk predictable falsehoods.
- Prepare rapid‑response summaries in advance.
- Verify fast, not perfectly.

## 2. Emotion Drives Reach
Facts without emotion do not travel.
- Tie truth to human stakes.
- Use moral clarity.
- Evoke anger, relief, pride, or urgency.

## 3. Radical Simplicity Wins
Complex truth loses to simple lies.
- One idea per message.
- One sentence that survives screenshots.
- One visual when possible.

## 4. Trust Messengers, Not Institutions
People trust peers more than authorities.
- Use credible insiders and local voices.
- Former skeptics persuade better than lifelong believers.

## 5. Repeat Without Apology
Repetition builds memory.
- Silence creates space for lies.
- Repeating truth is not propaganda; it is necessary.

## 6. Design for Algorithms
Algorithms reward engagement, not accuracy.
- Short beats long.
- Visual beats text.
- Clear framing beats nuance.

## 7. Apply Social Consequences
Bad ideas die when they become embarrassing.
- Label falsehoods clearly.
- Enforce consistent reputational costs.

## 8. Accept Asymmetry
Not everyone can be persuaded.
- Focus on the persuadable middle.
- Strengthen allies so they amplify truth.

## Bottom Line
Truth only goes viral when it is deliberately designed to compete on speed, emotion, simplicity, repetition, and social dynamics. Anything less guarantees that lies will dominate.
