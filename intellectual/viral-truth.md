# Making Truth Go Viral: Competing With Lies in the Attention Economy
Truth does not spread by default; lies do. Lies are simpler, more emotional, and faster to produce. If truth is to compete, it must be engineered to win on the same terrain where lies thrive.

| # | Principle | Key Action Points |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Speed Is Non‑Negotiable | Pre‑bunk predictable falsehoods; prepare rapid‑response summaries in advance; verify fast, not perfectly. |
| 2 | Emotion Drives Reach | Tie truth to human stakes; use moral clarity; evoke anger, relief, pride, or urgency. |
| 3 | Radical Simplicity Wins | One idea per message; one sentence that survives screenshots; one visual when possible. |
| 4 | Trust Messengers, Not Institutions | Use credible insiders and local voices; former skeptics persuade better than lifelong believers. |
| 5 | Repeat Without Apology | Repetition builds memory; silence creates space for lies; repeating truth is necessary, not propaganda. |
| 6 | Design for Algorithms | Short beats long; visual beats text; clear framing beats nuance. |
| 7 | Apply Social Consequences | Label falsehoods clearly; enforce consistent reputational costs; make bad ideas socially costly. |
| 8 | Accept Asymmetry | Focus on the persuadable middle; strengthen allies so they amplify truth; accept not everyone can be persuaded. |

## Bottom Line
Truth only goes viral when it is deliberately designed to compete on speed, emotion, simplicity, repetition, and social dynamics. Anything less guarantees that lies will dominate.
