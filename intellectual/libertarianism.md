## Libertarianism
[Libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) on its own has many reasonable merits, but there is a particular modern strain, exemplified by the likes of Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, Elon Musk, and others, that can be harmful. While their arguments seem very logical and rational, upon closer examination they appear incompatible with fostering a just and cohesive society.

This strain often aligns with the concept of **[cold logic](cold-logic.md)**, where rigid rationality and ideological purity override empathy and social responsibility. Modern Libertarians and MAGA followers often advocate policies and positions that seem rational on the surface but disregard the complexity of human limitations and the need for compassion in governance. This approach, consciously or unconsciously, prioritizes a sterile form of reason that can fracture societal cohesion.

This extreme form of rationality overrides common sense and leads to anti-social tendencies when these social media personalities prioritize strict adherence to ideological principles over empathetic understanding or cooperative behavior in society. One example of this was [Joe Rogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan)'s push-back against COVID vaccines, insisting that his personal prerogative was more important than public health considerations.

The problem with this kind of libertarianism is that it assumes everyone has the capacity to make fully informed decisions, which is not realistic. Not everyone has the knowledge or resources to manage their own body like a wealthy celebrity, and promoting the body-sovereignty ideal to an audience of millions can be incredibly irresponsible, especially when public health is at stake. As highlighted in [notes on reflexivity](reflexivity.md), a thoughtful political philosophy should account for human limitations, and robust institutions play a crucial role in ensuring social cohesion and responsible governance.

Advocates of this worldview, such as [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand), [Rand Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul), [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), [Ben Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shiro), and Joe Rogan, often echo elements of this coldly logical perspective, though their positions may vary in nuance and intent.
